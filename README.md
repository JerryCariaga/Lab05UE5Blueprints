# Lab05UE5Blueprints

Jericho Cariaga:

To test this lab out, consider the following first to ensure that everything is working.

Make sure that the Starter Content folder is in the Content folder before starting. If it is not, grab a copy from a previous lab.

Open up the uproject file and everything should work. If not, try deleting everything, and redownloading.
